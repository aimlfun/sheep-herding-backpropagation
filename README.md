From blog posting: https://aimlfun.com/using-sheep-because-cats-wont-herd/

This application requires .net6 and Visual Studio 2022 (Community works).

1. Download https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/
2. Download the source-code as a ZIP. 
3. Save it where you like - I tend to use c:\repos\ai\{folder-name}, feel free to choose a better folder.
4. Open the solution, and enjoy!

Any problems? Post a comment on my blog, and I will happily try to assist.

Before use copy /Model/*.ai to c:\temp, otherwise the neural network will be untrained.

Training data took hours, and is 200,000 rows of data. Please see blog regarding creation of it.
